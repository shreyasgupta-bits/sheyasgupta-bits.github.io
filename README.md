# Site detailing my PS journey.

Hello,

I have made this site using the hugo static site creator hosted on GitHub Pages and integrated and testing using the CI/CD tool of GitHub Actions.

I used the "Contrast" theme available on Hugo. Its GiitHub link is [this](https://github.com/niklasbuschmann/contrast-hugo).

I had to configure a yaml file for this to integrate with GitHub Actions.

Used [this](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/hugo-setup) GitHub setup action to create my workflow.
