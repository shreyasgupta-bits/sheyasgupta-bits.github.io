  <p>I learned about what DevOps is; it is union of the siloed department of development and operations.<br>
It is useful in helping to give constant updates to your app and managing its deployment.</p>
<p>I read about docker and how it is a tool which enables to develop and run apps in containers.<br>
I read about containers and how they are different from VMs in the sense that VM is the virtualization of the hardware, while containers are virtualizations of the OS and how their structure is just different.</p>
<p>I installed docker on my linux VM.<br>
I was facing an issue when trying to set up a docker repository as was said in the documentation. But when I tried the same thing when trying to record for the daily update it ended up working.

<p>But before using this I installed docker using the scipt <code>sudo apt install docker.io</code>, which worker perfectly.<br>
After installing for the first time I ran <code>sudo docker run hello-world</code>.
