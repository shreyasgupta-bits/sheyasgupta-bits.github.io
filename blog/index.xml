      <description> Downloaded hugo which is a website creating tool and experimented on it by creating my first website. Tried downloading asciinema but since Im running windows, was unable to do so. A possible solution as proposed by my mentor was to use a VM with linux. Downloaded Virtualbox, an Oracle VMware and understood how a VM works.  </description>

      <description> Installed Git and learnt about version control systems. Learnt about how to write in markdown. Started a repo and committed a markdown page. Pushed an html file but had an issue with deploying a github page which displayed my markdown page as my html file could be viewed. Fixed this issue by first deleting the html file and then launching a github page.  </description>
