This is the log which is going to be kept by me detailing my work done during my internship at [NPBridge Solutions Pvt. Ltd.](https://www.npbridge.com)

This internship has been assigned to me by my college- **BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus**.
I am currently a second year student majoring in *Computer Science*.

## Day 1

1. Installed Git and learnt about version control systems.
2. Learnt about how to write in markdown.
3. Started a repo and committed a markdown page.
4. Pushed an html file but had an issue with deploying a github page which displayed my markdown page as my html file could be viewed. Fixed this issue by first deleting the html file and then launching a github page.

## Day 2

1. Downloaded hugo which is a website creating tool and experimented on it by creating my first website.
2. Tried downloading asciinema but since Im running windows, was unable to do so. A possible solution as proposed by my mentor was to use a VM with linux.
3. Downloaded Virtualbox, an Oracle VMware and learned how to install linux on it.
