      <description>Today I started off with downloading ansible.  I then continued how to build docker containers using the docker/getting-started container.  Over there they had a .zip file to download in which I created a Dockerfile in the root directory of the folder whose contents were:  Content of Dockerfile   I have to still learn how to embed files cause nothing is working.
In this the Dockerfile downloaded the node image with 12-alpine tag, yarn was used to download the various dependencies and the CMD directive specifies the commands to be run when the container is run.</description>

      <description>I learned about what DevOps is; it is union of the siloed department of development and operations.
It is useful in helping to give constant updates to your app and managing its deployment.
I read about docker and how it is a tool which enables to develop and run apps in containers.
I read about containers and how they are different from VMs in the sense that VM is the virtualization of the hardware, while containers are virtualizations of the OS and how their structure is just different.</description>

Downloaded Virtualbox, an Oracle VMware and understood how a VM works.  </description>
